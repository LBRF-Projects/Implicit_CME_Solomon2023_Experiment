# Implicit Learning of a Kinematically Complex Multi-Articular Motor Skill

This repository contains the experiment anad analysis code for Solomon et al. (2023), a study investigating if a complex movement can be learned implicitly.

This study uses [TraceLab](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLab).


## Experiment Code

The experiment code used to collect the data is found in the `Tracelab_Program` directory. The code has been left in its original form, and as such will require modification to run on modern versions of Python as Tracelab has undergone several updates since the data was collected for the project. This directory is strictly for documentation purposes. For a functional version of the program, please visit [TraceLab](https://github.com/LBRF/TraceLab).


## Analysis

The analysis for this project can be found in the [Implicit_CME_Analysis](https://github.com/LBRF-Projects/Implicit_CME_Solomon2023_Analysis) repository.
